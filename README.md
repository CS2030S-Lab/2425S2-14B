# Hi, welcome to CS2030S Lab 14B GitHub Forum!

### Forum policies to take note!
1. This forum is strictly for gathering questions that we as tutors can't or don't have time to answer during the lab itself.
2. You are still encouraged to use Ed discussion as the main platform of discussion, as that's the only platform under Profs' supervision, and we believe the best learning outcomes should still be achieved through peer learning. Hence, please do not take advantage of this forum as way to by-pass Ed discussion and get direct help from us. We can't always guarantee an answer to your question.
3. We are mostly active on Ed discussion ourselves! So if you are going to post any question here, please at least show us that you have tried to solve the issue/understand the topic yourself OR have seeked help on Ed before posting the question here
4. This forum is **not** for troubleshooting or resolving any technical issues(environment, test case fails), please seek help from your fellow classmates or Profs if needed.

### How to use this forum
In case you are not familiar with using GitHub, you can make use of **GitHub Issue Tracker** to post your question in this Platform, by following these few steps:
1. Click `Issues` at the top of the page.
2. Click the green button at the top right hand corner which says `New Issues`.
3. Add title and description of your question and click `Create`.
4. Once done, you will be seeing your question created as a new issue in the issue page.
5. Feel free to enable `watching` feature of this repo to get timely updates on the activites in the repo, or you can simply check your notification inbox to look for our replies.

### Note: 
Please following GitHub markdown syntax to properly structure the questions so that it is easy for people to read and understand your issue, for common best practices:
1. Please do not post any code snippets as screenshots, instead use backtick(\`) to surround single line of code better presentation, such as `this`
2. For multi-line/blocks of code, use triple backticks(\`\`\`), such as
   ```
    public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello World");
       }
   }
   ```
4. For more detailed guide on formatting syntax on Github, refer to: [GitHub Markdown Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

5. Happy Coding!
